# Midi2Powershell
A simple python midi to powershell beeper converter

The program works by you having a input.mid file and an output .ps1 file in the same directory as the converter. You paste this command in to your terminal python Converter.py input.mid output.ps1 and it runs.
Currently the program only gives you the beeps and you can run it in vscode it needs some tweeking to get running in powershell natively.
